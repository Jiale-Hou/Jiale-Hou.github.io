I strive to understand the social media world and its impact.

My research focuses on **social media & international news**, with a particular interest in how digital platforms shape the production, circulation, and interpretation of news across national and cultural contexts. I am especially interested in the role of social media in global information flows, public discourse, and the dynamics of attention in international communication.

**Currently**, my work explores how international news is selected, framed, and amplified on social media platforms, as well as how audiences engage with and make sense of global events online.

I am a **PhD student** in the [School of Information and Communication Studies](https://www.ucd.ie/ics/) at University College Dublin.
